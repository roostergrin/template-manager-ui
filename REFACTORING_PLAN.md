# Context API & Custom Hooks Refactoring Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the complete refactoring plan to modernize the Template Manager UI codebase with React Context API and enhanced custom hooks. The plan follows a testing-first approach to ensure no regressions during the refactoring process.

## Current State Analysis
- **Heavy prop drilling**: `questionnaireData` flows through 4+ component levels
- **State fragmentation**: Related state scattered across WorkflowManager, multiple hooks, and localStorage
- **Single context**: Only `GithubRepoContext` exists, but many other state pieces need global access
- **Complex component props**: Components like `EnhancedSitemap` receive 6+ props that could be context-based
- **No testing infrastructure**: Critical risk for refactoring without breaking functionality

## Refactoring Goals
- Eliminate 80%+ of current prop drilling
- Centralize related state management
- Improve component reusability and testability
- Maintain type safety with proper TypeScript contexts
- Preserve React Query patterns (no conflicts)
